# Password-Generator-JS-Challenge-3
This repository contains a project worked from modified code that practices what I've learned from javascript this past week. 

## What I want to Accomplish
I want to create a random password generator that allows the user to hit the generate button, and randomly generated password will appear in the text box. This password will include a length of 8-128 characters, special characters, and a mix of uppercase and lowercase alphabet. 

## How I'm going to Accomplish these goals
I will look through my previous assignments for Javascript and Web APIs. I will break down the problem by identifying the different variables I need to declare for the password. Created an object with a list of requirements I will want for generated password. 

Check it out!
